# <Hello, world!/>

## Hey there! I'm Arthur, It's nice to have you here!

### Well, I'm new to code, but you have no idea of how much I like it already. It's so much fun to solve a bug, to spend sometimes hours thinking of a solution to a problem that's not working as it should, and then, from nowhere, you have an(other) idea and you change some code here and there and BOOM, It's solved! I really hope for having this feeling for the rest of my career.

- ðŸ’» Iâ€™m working on improving my Web Development skills, currently learning how to master the front and backend.
- ðŸ“š Iâ€™m 100% dedicated on improving my Javascript, Node.JS and DATABSE. 
- âŒ¨ Always building my projects with HTML, CSS, JS and REACTJS or BOOTSTRAP.
- ðŸ›  Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any project that's open to get an extra hand on it.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: contatoagusmao@gmail.com 

#### Don't forget to take a look into my pinned projects and feel free for some feedback. Thanks for comming!
