# <Hello, world!/>

## Well, as you know, I'm Arthur. Nice to meet you!

### I'm new to code, but you have no idea of how much I like it. It's so much preasure to me to solve a bug, to spend sometimes hours thinking of a solution to something that's not working as It's supose to, when from nowhere you have an idea, you change some code here and there and BOOM, It's solved! I really hope that this isn't a beginer feeling and hope for having It for the rest of my career.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on improving my skills on web development, learning how to master the front and backend.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Javascript, Node.JS ReactJS and MySQL.
