# <Hello, world!/>

## Well, as you know, I'm Arthur. Nice to meet you!

### I'm new to code, but you have no idea of how much I like it already. It's so much fun to me to solve a bug, to spend sometimes hours thinking of a solution to something that's not working as it's supose to and, from nowhere, you have an idea, and you change some code here and there and BOOM, It's solved! I really hope for having this feeling for the rest of my career.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on improving my skills on web development, learning how to master the front and backend.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Javascript, Node.JS ReactJS and MySQL.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any project that needs an extra hand on it.
